# Week 4 - Digit Factorials:

## Problem:

The factorial of a number n is the multiplication of all the integers from 1 to n inclusive. Factorials are represented with a ! in maths (no, you cannot use a ! to factorise in your code, ! is instead the NOT operator in code).

For example, \
3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6.\
5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

145 is a 'curious' number because 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of ALL positive integers where the sum of the factorials of their digits is equal to number itself - AKA the sum of all curious numbers.
