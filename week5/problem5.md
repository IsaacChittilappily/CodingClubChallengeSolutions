# Week 5 - Single Number - 11/06/24

## Problem - Difficulty 3/10:
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Part 2: (Extension - Difficulty 6/10):
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Case 1:

input = [2,2,1]
output = 1

### Case 2:
input = [1,2,3,2,1,4,6,4]
output = 6

### Case 3:
input = [1,1,2,2,3,4,4]
output = 3
