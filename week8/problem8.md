### Problem 1 - Difficulty 4/10:

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:
1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:
(1+2+...+10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is:

3025 - 385 = 2640

Find the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum of the first one hundred natural numbers.
