# Coding Club Challenges

This replit will contain the solution(s) to each weeks challenge(s) and I will update it at the end of each Tuesday session, so that students who tried and failed at a solution can take a look at where they went wrong.

Each solution will have its own folder, labelled with the date the challenge was set so you can find previous solutions easily. Each folder will contain a problem.md with the problem that was set, a solution.md which contains my thought process to solving the problem, and a solution.py, which holds the actual code for the solution.


### NOTE - If you want to run some of the solutions yourself and dont want to copy and paste, fork this repl and then go to the 'config.txt' file. Replace the number in there with the week number of the code you want to run, and then just run the project - the main.py file will handle everything else :D

Bear in mind that I am not a coding grandmaster by any means so if you find any inefficiencies or straight errors in my code, feel free to tell me at the next session.

Happy Coding!
